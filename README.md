# Woo Block Experiments
A plugin for prototyping experimental iterations on various woo block behaviour. This is not intended for production use.

Experiments are done in their own branch so that the same skeleton can be re-used for various experiments.

## Active Experiments

### Cart and Checkout Blocks i2

**Branch**: checkout-flow-i2

This experiment is validating the structural behaviour of various block and inner block structures and definitions to ensure various ui and ux requirements are possible to implement with the recent versions of Gutenberg (and also what requirements of Gutenberg are needed).
